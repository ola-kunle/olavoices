Subject: Authentic Nigerian Voice for {{company}}'s Training Content

Hi {{firstName}},

I came across {{company}}'s work on {{recentProject}} in West Africa and was impressed by your commitment to culturally authentic health communication.

I'm a professional Nigerian voice actor specializing in corporate narration and public health content. I've worked with international clients to create training materials that truly resonate with local Nigerian and West African audiences.

Quick question: Does {{company}} currently produce voice-over content for training videos, PSAs, or educational materials in the region?

Authentic local voices can significantly improve engagement and trust with target communities—something I've seen firsthand in my work.

I'd be happy to share my portfolio and discuss how we might collaborate on future projects.

Best regards,
Ola
