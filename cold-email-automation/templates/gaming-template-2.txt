Subject: Re: Nigerian Voice Actor - Interested in Collaborating

Hi {{firstName}},

Following up on my email about voice-over collaboration.

I know casting timelines vary, so I wanted to make this easy:

✓ Professional Nigerian accent (authentic, not stereotypical)
✓ Home studio (broadcast quality)
✓ Experience with character voices
✓ Rates: $200-600 depending on scope

Even if you're not casting now, I'd love to be on your radar for future projects.

Reply with "demo" and I'll send my reel.

Best,
Ola
