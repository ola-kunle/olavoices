Subject: Re: Authentic Nigerian Voice for {{company}}'s Training Content

Hi {{firstName}},

I wanted to follow up on my email from earlier this week.

I know you're likely managing multiple projects, so I'll keep this brief:

I specialize in providing authentic Nigerian voice-over for:
• Public health campaign videos
• Training materials for health workers
• Educational PSAs
• IVR systems for community hotlines

If you're working on any content for West African audiences, I'd love to send you some samples.

Just reply with "yes" and I'll share my portfolio.

Best,
Ola
