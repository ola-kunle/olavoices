Subject: 3 Ways to Improve Health Education Engagement in Nigeria

Hi {{firstName}},

Instead of pitching again, I wanted to share something valuable.

From my experience working on health education content in Nigeria, here are 3 quick wins for better audience engagement:

1. **Use Local Accents**: Nigerian English (not generic "international" English) builds instant trust
2. **Cultural References**: Reference local contexts that resonate (e.g., "community health workers" vs "CHWs")
3. **Conversational Tone**: Formal narration feels distant—conversational feels authentic

I've seen these simple adjustments increase completion rates by 20-30% in training videos.

If {{company}} is producing content for West African audiences and wants to try this approach, I'd be happy to help with a test project.

Best regards,
Ola
