Subject: Authentic African Character Voice Guide

Hi {{firstName}},

Instead of another pitch, I wanted to share something useful:

**5 Tips for Authentic African Character Voices**

Many games feature African characters but miss the mark on authentic voices. Here's what works:

1. **Regional Specificity**: "African accent" doesn't exist—Nigerian ≠ Kenyan ≠ South African
2. **Avoid Stereotypes**: Not every African character is wise/tribal/mystical
3. **Contemporary Context**: Modern African characters speak like modern people
4. **Code-Switching**: Many Africans naturally blend English with local phrases
5. **Professional Quality**: Authentic doesn't mean amateur

If you're developing games with African characters and want this level of authenticity, I'd love to help.
