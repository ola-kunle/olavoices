Subject: Authentic Nigerian Voice Talent for {{company}}

Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed {{company}} has been expanding character diversity in recent titles like {{recentProject}}—really impressive work on authentic representation.

I'm a professional Nigerian voice actor specializing in character voices and diverse accents. As studios continue creating more globally authentic characters, I wanted to introduce myself for future casting opportunities.

My range includes:
• Nigerian English (various regional accents)
• West African characters
• Hero/protagonist voices
• NPC background dialogue
• Tutorial/narrator roles

Quick question: Does {{company}} maintain a roster of diverse voice talent for upcoming projects?

I'd love to submit my demo reel for consideration.

Best regards,
Ola
