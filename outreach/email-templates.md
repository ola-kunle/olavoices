## TEMPLATE SET 1: NGOs & Development Organizations

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject Line Options:**
- Authentic Nigerian Voice for [Organization]'s Training Content
- Local Voice Talent for Your West Africa Health Campaigns
- Professional Nigerian Narration for [Project Name]

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I came across [Organization]'s work on [specific project/initiative] in West Africa and was impressed by your commitment to culturally authentic health communication.

I'm a professional Nigerian voice actor specializing in corporate narration and public health content. I've worked with international clients to create training materials that truly resonate with local Nigerian and West African audiences.

Quick question: Does [Organization] currently produce voice-over content for training videos, PSAs, or educational materials in the region?

Authentic local voices can significantly improve engagement and trust with target communities—something I've seen firsthand in my work.

I'd be happy to share my portfolio and discuss how we might collaborate on future projects.

Best regards,

### Email 2: Follow-Up (3 days later if no response)

**Subject:** Re: Authentic Nigerian Voice for [Organization]'s Training Content

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I wanted to follow up on my email from earlier this week.

I know you're likely managing multiple projects, so I'll keep this brief:

I specialize in providing authentic Nigerian voice-over for:
• Public health campaign videos
• Training materials for health workers
• Educational PSAs
• IVR systems for community hotlines

If you're working on any content for West African audiences, I'd love to send you some samples.

Just reply with "yes" and I'll share my portfolio.

Best,
Ola

### Email 3: Value Bomb (7 days after Email 2)

**Subject:** 3 Ways to Improve Health Education Engagement in Nigeria

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Instead of pitching again, I wanted to share something valuable.

From my experience working on health education content in Nigeria, here are 3 quick wins for better audience engagement:

1. **Use Local Accents**: Nigerian English (not generic "international" English) builds instant trust
2. **Cultural References**: Reference local contexts that resonate (e.g., "community health workers" vs "CHWs")
3. **Conversational Tone**: Formal narration feels distant—conversational feels authentic

I've seen these simple adjustments increase completion rates by 20-30% in training videos.

If [Organization] is producing content for West African audiences and wants to try this approach, I'd be happy to help with a test project.

Best regards,
Ola

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Studio Name] has been expanding character diversity in recent titles like [Game Name]—really impressive work on authentic representation.

### Email 2: Initial Outreach (Indie Studios)

**Subject Line:** Nigerian Voice Actor - Interested in Collaborating

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm a voice actor based in Lagos, Nigeria, and I love what you're building with [Game/Studio Name].

Indie studios often need diverse, authentic voices but struggle with budgets—I get it. That's why I offer flexible rates for indie developers creating meaningful African content or featuring diverse characters.

My specialty:
• Character voices (heroes, NPCs, villains)
• Various Nigerian/West African accents
• Professional home studio setup
• Fast turnaround

Would you be open to discussing voice talent needs for [current/upcoming project]?

I'm happy to work within indie budgets while maintaining AAA quality.

### Email 3: Follow-Up (Gaming)

**Subject:** Re: Nigerian Voice Actor - Interested in Collaborating

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email about voice-over collaboration.

I know casting timelines vary, so I wanted to make this easy:

✓ Professional Nigerian accent (authentic, not stereotypical)
✓ Home studio (broadcast quality)
✓ Experience with character voices
✓ Rates: $200-600 depending on scope

Even if you're not casting now, I'd love to be on your radar for future projects.

Reply with "demo" and I'll send my reel.

Best,
Ola

### Email 4: Value Email for Gaming

**Subject:** Free Resource: Authentic African Character Voice Guide

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Instead of another pitch, I created something useful for game developers:

**"5 Tips for Authentic African Character Voices"**

Many games feature African characters but miss the mark on authentic voices. Here's what works:

1. **Regional Specificity**: "African accent" doesn't exist—Nigerian ≠ Kenyan ≠ South African
2. **Avoid Stereotypes**: Not every African character is wise/tribal/mystical
3. **Contemporary Context**: Modern African characters speak like modern people
4. **Code-Switching**: Many Africans naturally blend English with local phrases
5. **Professional Quality**: Authentic doesn't mean amateur

If you're developing games with African characters and want this level of authenticity, I'd love to help.

Best regards,
Ola
